# AirshipProject

Year 2 University Team Project Assignment. I worked in a team with 4 other random classmates to produce a game in Unreal Engine 4's Blueprint system. The time allotted for finishing the project was about 9 weeks.

The game we built is an airship battle arena type of game, in which you control an airship with clunky movement and your goal is to kill as many pirates as you can in order to obtain a high score. The game itself is mostly a tech demo, a testament to ourselves that we are familiar with the engine and, given enough time and some guidance, could do even greater things with it.

Neither of us had any significant prior experience with the engine, so we spent a couple of weeks learning the basics of UE4's Blueprint system and making little progress on the game itself. We decided to split our tasks in order to hopefully achieve something impressive. 

I worked on the game's mechanics and assembling everyone's bits of the project together. I also worked a bit on the AI, UI and the procedural generation featured in the game (the rocks in the sky are generated using a procedural algorithm as we expected the game to be a lot larger). I attached some screenshots in the BlueprintScreenshots folder that shows some of the blueprint work I've done.
